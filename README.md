C-based Student Report Card System for Turbo C only. Allows adding student details, calculating grades, and displaying reports. ⚠ Not compatible with GCC or modern compilers.
# 🎓 Student Report Card System (Turbo C Only)

A simple C-based Student Report Card System that allows users to manage student academic records through a menu-driven console program. This project is developed *specifically for Turbo C*, and uses old-school functions like clrscr() and getch() for screen and keyboard handling.

## 🧾 Project Overview

This program enables users to:
- Add student details
- Input subject marks
- Calculate total marks, percentage, and grade
- Display student report cards in a clear format

It's ideal for learning the basics of:
- File handling in C
- Conditional logic
- Functions
- Structured programming

## ⚙ Setup Instructions (Turbo C Only)

1. Install *Turbo C* or *Turbo C++, or use **TurboSeq* (modern wrapper for Turbo C).
2. Download or copy the file report.c from this repository.
3. Open Turbo C IDE.
4. Load the file using File → Open.
5. Compile the code using Ctrl + F9.
6. Run the program using Ctrl + F5.

> ⚠ *Important:* This project will *not compile or run* in:
> - GCC
> - Code::Blocks
> - VS Code (MinGW or other compilers)
> - Any modern C IDEs  
> Because it uses Borland-specific functions and the conio.h library.

## 🧠 Functionality & Usage Guide

When you run the program, you’ll see a *menu-driven interface*. The options include:

- ✅ Add new student data
- ✅ Enter marks for multiple subjects
- ✅ Calculate percentage & assign grade
- ✅ View the complete report
- ✅ Exit the application

Navigation is done through keyboard inputs. All actions happen within the terminal window.

## 📝 Special Notes

- *Compatibility:* Strictly written for *Turbo C only*.
- *Learning Purpose:* This project is a great starting point to practice:
  - Old-style C programming
  - Console-based UI
  - Modular function handling
- *No external files or databases used*; data is handled in memory or simple text-based storage (if you added file handling).
